title: Negativity >> Positivity
---

How many act of goodness is equal to an act of evil. If someone commits a crime how many acts of good must they do in order to for them to bad. They say it takes 25 acts of goodness for a person to make up for committing a murder. But why cant positivity = negativity?


There was research done where they tested how fast people responded to negativity compared to positivity. They would have these people sit in front of a computer and look at a dot at the center of the computer screen. There would be a word that would flash around that dot. If the word was a symbol of good the person would press a the right button. If the word was a symbol of negativity, fear or sadness then the person would press the left button. When people were tested researchers found that people would respond reasonably to the events.

But when researchers started "priming" in which they would display fear at the center of the dot right before flashing the word, people tend to respond faster after being primed.
