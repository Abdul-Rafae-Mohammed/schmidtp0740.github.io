# <center> About Me </center>

Hello! My name is Philip Schmidt and I am from St. Paul, MN. I am currently a student and work part time at the Department of Motor Vehicles for Minnesota. In my free time I like to lift weights, read books, work on side projects, and practice playing the piano. I am also learning how to speak Portuguese since I frequently visit Brazil to visit family from time to time. I am currently a student at the University of Wisconsin - Stout studying in Computer Science. I am concentrating in Software Development as well as Cyber Security and Information Assurance. I am planning to graduate in May 2017.

I create applications for many platforms like mobile devices as well as web applications. I have a strong focus to secure data and privacy that applications manage but also aspire to create processes that others can use.
